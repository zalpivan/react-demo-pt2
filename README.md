# React Skills Demo Part 2

This repository contains all of the code examples and exercise solutions to demonstrate what I have just learn about React advanced usage.

I have designed this repository to show you everything you need to know to verify if I am a proficient React developer. This repository is the second part of a three-part series, covering the fundamentals. It shows that I am already aware how to:

- Fetching and updating data with React Query
- All about reducers, context, and providers
- Managing application state with Zustand
- Routing with React Router

With this repository, I would like to show that have a solid understanding of React and am able to build real-world applications with React and TypeScript.
